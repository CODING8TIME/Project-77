        <h1>Project on Console</h1>
        <p>Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.</p>

            <p>Code consoles enable you to run code interactively in a kernel. The cells of a code console show the order in which code was executed in the kernel, as opposed to the explicit ordering of cells in a notebook document. Code consoles also display rich output, just like notebook cells.
